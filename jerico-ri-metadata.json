    "description": "These applications are written in Matlab language and they are designed for High Frequency Radar (HFR) data management according to the European HFR node processing workflow. These applications aggregate historical (i.e. not processed for NRT operation, i.e. not present in the EU HFR Node NRT THREDDS catalog) HFR radial and total files in netCDF format according to the European standard data and metadata model for near real time HFR current data in order to produce temporally aggregated datasets to be pushed towards CMEMS-INSTAC for the REP products.",
